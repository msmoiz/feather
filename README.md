Feather does not depend on any libraries (except [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for testing) and employs virtual terminal sequences to handle input and render output. It currently supports Windows only. The project was written over the course of a few days and was a good exercise in console manipulation, test-driven development, and architectural design.
